# 🤖 Rugs.Fun Trading Bot (Solana)

This is an automated trading bot for [Rugs.Fun](https://rugs.fun), the high-speed, on-chain Solana game where players buy and sell synthetic charts to profit before the "rug pull".

The bot monitors chart data and executes trades (buy/sell) based on basic heuristics and performance trends to maximize profitability.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Basic analysis of price patterns and volatility
- 🤝 Auto-buy and auto-sell via Solana wallet (Keypair or Phantom CLI)
- 📈 Tracks profitability over time
- 🛠 Easily extendable for custom strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/topsecretagent007/rug.fun-bot.git
cd rugfun-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
PRIVATE_KEY=[*******-*******-******-*****-***]
```

> ⚠️ Keep your private key secure. Do NOT share this file or commit it to version control.

## 📊 How It Works

1. Connects to Rugs.Fun chart data endpoint or listens to on-chain account data.
2. Monitors round start and price volatility.
3. Executes `buy()` if favorable condition detected.
4. Calls `sell()` before the rug pull based on expected volatility drop or time window.

## 📄 Example Strategy Logic

```ts
if (currentPriceTrend === *** ) {
  buy()
}

if (profitPercent ***) {
  sell()
}
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Use a low-funds burner wallet for safety.
- Monitor your logs before enabling continuous execution.
